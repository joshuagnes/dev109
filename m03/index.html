  <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
  <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a
    mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
  <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a
      href="https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-10/thinking-inside-the-box-borderless.html">England</a>
    and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized
    versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a
      href="https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-10/thinking-inside-the-box-borderless.html">English
      estate gardens</a>.</p>
  <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and
    herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
